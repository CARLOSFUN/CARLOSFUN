# Carlos Funezsanchez

Security-focused practitioner with a SOC and incident response mindset. I build and document hands-on threat hunting and endpoint investigation work using real telemetry, with a focus on repeatable detection outcomes.

## About Me

I approach security work like an analyst, starting with telemetry and working toward evidence-based conclusions. I regularly hunt for suspicious behavior, scope impact, and document findings so they can be repeated or operationalized. I focus on investigation workflows that move from triage to validation and remediation without losing context. I use Linux and systems knowledge to support investigations, validate host behavior, and understand operational constraints. I keep my work grounded in real data and clear documentation so others can follow and reproduce the process.

## What I Do

- Build detection-focused investigations that translate endpoint telemetry into actionable triage and response steps.
- Analyze suspicious activity with clear scoping, evidence collection, and remediation guidance.
- Design defensive workflows that reduce alert fatigue and improve visibility across endpoints.

## Featured Projects

### Threat Hunting & SOC Investigations

**[Threat Hunting Scenario: Tor Browser Usage](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/threat-hunting-scenario-tor)**
Identified unapproved anonymization tools across enterprise endpoints to surface policy violations.
Analyzed Microsoft Defender and Sentinel telemetry to validate usage patterns and scope affected hosts.
Skills: KQL threat hunting, endpoint telemetry analysis, investigation workflow design

**[RDP Compromise CTF (End-to-End SOC Investigation)](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/RDP-Compromise-CTF)**
Investigated a simulated RDP compromise to reconstruct attacker behavior from initial access to remediation.
Built KQL hunting queries and mapped activity to MITRE ATT&CK to document evidence and response steps.
Skills: KQL threat hunting, incident investigation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, documentation

### Vulnerability Management

**[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/vulnerability-management-program)**
Defined a structured lifecycle for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities at scale.
Built documentation and workflows that connect intake, risk ranking, and remediation tracking.
Skills: program design, risk prioritization, remediation workflow documentation

**Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations (PowerShell + BASH) (Coming Soon)**
Automated patching and remediation tasks across Linux and Windows environments to reduce manual effort.
Built scripts and workflows focused on consistent coverage and repeatable remediation outcomes.
Skills: PowerShell, Bash, remediation automation

### Linux & Systems

**Linux+ Practice Labs (In Progress)**
Developed hands-on competence in user management, boot processes, and scripting for operational readiness.
Built lab exercises across Rocky Linux and Ubuntu to validate core administration tasks.
