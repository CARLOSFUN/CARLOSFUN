# Carlos Funezsanchez

Security-focused practitioner with a SOC and incident response mindset. I build and document hands-on threat hunting and endpoint investigation work using real telemetry, with a focus on repeatable detection outcomes.

## What I Do

- Build detection-focused investigations that translate endpoint telemetry into actionable triage and response steps.
- Analyze suspicious activity with clear scoping, evidence collection, and remediation guidance.
- Design defensive workflows that reduce alert fatigue and improve visibility across endpoints.

## Featured Projects

### Threat Hunting & SOC Investigations

- **[CorpHealth Traceback Threat Hunt (End-to-End Investigation)](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/corphealth-traceback-threat-hunt)**
  - **Problem solved:** Reconstructed a suspicious activity timeline involving potential misuse of an operational maintenance account using endpoint telemetry.
  - **Tools/skills:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Advanced Hunting (KQL), process/network/file/registry correlation, timeline analysis.
  - **Why it matters:** Simulates a real-world SOC investigation of anomalous behavior with multiple attack phases, including staging artifacts, persistence mechanisms, privilege manipulation, and command-and-control.

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario: Tor Browser Usage](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/threat-hunting-scenario-tor)**
  - **Problem solved:** Identify unapproved anonymization tools across enterprise endpoints.
  - **Tools/skills:** Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, KQL, investigation workflow design.
  - **Why it matters:** Helps security teams detect policy violations and potential data exfiltration paths.

- **[RDP Compromise CTF (End-to-End SOC Investigation)](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/RDP-Compromise-CTF)**
  - **Problem solved:** Investigate a simulated RDP-based intrusion from initial access to remediation.
  - **Tools/skills:** KQL hunting queries, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, incident documentation.
  - **Why it matters:** Mirrors common attack paths and trains responders on evidence-driven decisions.

### Vulnerability Management

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/CARLOSFUN/vulnerability-management-program)**
  - **Problem solved:** Establish a structured lifecycle for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities.
  - **Tools/skills:** Program design, risk prioritization, remediation workflow documentation.
  - **Why it matters:** Provides a repeatable process for reducing risk at scale.

- **Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations (PowerShell + BASH) (Coming Soon)**
  - **Problem solved:** Automate patching and remediation tasks across mixed Linux and Windows environments.
  - **Tools/skills:** PowerShell, Bash, remediation automation.
  - **Why it matters:** Improves coverage and consistency while reducing manual effort.

### Linux & Systems

- **Linux+ Practice Labs (In Progress)**
  - **Problem solved:** Build hands-on competence in user management, boot processes, and scripting.
  - **Tools/skills:** Rocky Linux, Ubuntu, system administration.
  - **Why it matters:** Strengthens operational foundations used in security investigations.

- **RHCSA Labs (Coming Soon)**
  - **Problem solved:** Practice real-world system configuration, networking, and security tasks.
  - **Tools/skills:** Red Hat tooling, service hardening, system configuration.
  - **Why it matters:** Validates enterprise-grade Linux administration skills.
